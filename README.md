## Worrywart is a simulation game where students spread their ```stress```.

This is not true. ```Stress``` does the job as well.

Inspired heavily by Conway's Game of Life *(and zombie media)*, this cellular automata *(fancy!)* project follows these simple behaviours:
- Characters on the same side group together
- Characters move randomly once they found their friends *(or if they couldn't)*
- Worrywarts chase Students
- Libraries convert Worrywarts back into Students
- Walls block movement

All other behaviours are **emergent**!

Here's a couple active examples
